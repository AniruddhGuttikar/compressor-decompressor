# Compressor and Decompressor in C

## Overview

This repository contains a simple command-line program written in C for compressing and decompressing text files. The compression algorithm utilized is based on heap data structures. The program includes two main components: `compressor.c` for compressing files and `decompressor.c` for decompressing previously compressed files.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have any latest version of C installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Place your input text file in the same directory as the program files and name it "input_file.txt".
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the compressor and decompressor programs separately using the following commands:

    ```bash
    gcc compressor.c -o compressor
    gcc decompressor.c -o decompressor
    ```

4. Run the compressor on the input file:

    ```bash
    ./compressor
    ```

    This will generate a compressed file named "output_file.bin" in the same directory.

5. To decompress the file, run the decompressor:

    ```bash
    ./decompressor
    ```

    This will produce the decompressed file named "file-decompressed.txt" in the same directory.

## File Structure

- `compressor.c`: Source code for the compressor program.
- `decompressor.c`: Source code for the decompressor program.
- `heap.h`: Header file containing necessary data structures and functions for heap operations.
